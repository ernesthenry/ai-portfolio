# AutoGen: Multi-Agent Supply Chain Negotiation

**Skills:** `pyautogen`, Multi-Agent Orchestration, Automated Negotiation.

**Business Use Case:** Supply Chain Automation.
Instead of a human emailing a supplier, an AI Agent negotiates pricing based on real-time inventory and budget constraints.

**How it works:**

1.  **Logistics Agent:** Wants to buy low.
2.  **Supplier Agent:** Wants to sell high.
3.  **Analyst Agent:** Approves/Rejects based on risk.
4.  **AutoGen:** Orchestrates the "Conversation" until a deal is struck.
