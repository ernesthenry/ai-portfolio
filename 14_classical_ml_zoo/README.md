# Classical ML Zoo

**Goal:** Fill the gaps. Deep Learning isn't the solution to everything.
These scripts demonstrate mastery of the "Scikit-Learn Ecosystem".

## 1. Supervised Classics (`supervised_classics.py`)

- **SVM:** Handling non-linear boundaries.
- **KNN:** Distance-based learning.
- **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic learning.
- **Decision Trees:** Rule-based learning.

## 2. Unsupervised & Anomaly (`unsupervised_specialties.py`)

- **Isolation Forest:** The industry standard for **Fraud Detection** (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection).
- **PCA:** Reducing 50 features to 2 for visualization.
- **DBSCAN:** Clustering without knowing 'k' (density based).
