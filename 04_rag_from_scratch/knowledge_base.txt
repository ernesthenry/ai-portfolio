The "Lunaris-X" is a prototype electric aircraft developed by Cyberdyne Systems in 2024.
Unlike traditional planes, the Lunaris-X uses an ionic propulsion drive, making it completely silent.
The top speed of the Lunaris-X is Mach 2.5, but it can only fly for 45 minutes before recharging.
The pilot of the first test flight was Captain Sarah Connor.
The Lunaris-X is painted entirely matte black to absorb solar radiation for auxiliary power.
