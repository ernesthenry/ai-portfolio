# TypeScript AI Engineer (Node.js + LangChain.js)



This project proves exact parity between my Python skills and the required TypeScript stack.

## The Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js / TypeScript
- **Orchestration:** LangChain.js
- **Validation:** Zod (The TypeSafe standard, equivalent to Pydantic)
- **Model:** OpenAI (via API)

## What it does

1.  **Ingests unstructured text** (e.g., an email from an AI CEO).
2.  **Validates it against a strict Zod Schema** (Sentiment, Entities, Risk Score).
3.  **Executes downstream business logic** based on the AI's output (Risk flagging).

## How to run

```bash
cd 19_typescript_agentic_workflow
npm install
npm start
```
