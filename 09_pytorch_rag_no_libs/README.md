# PyTorch RAG (No Libraries)

**Goal:** Demonstrate deep understanding of Vector Search by building it from scratch using only Matrix Multiplication.

**Why this matters:**
Most engineers use `ChromaDB` or `FAISS` and treat search as a "Black Box".
This project proves you understand:

1. **Tokenization & Pooling:** How to turn text into a vector using a raw BERT model.
2. **Normalization:** Why L2 Norm is crucial for Cosine Similarity.
3. **Linear Algebra:** How `matmul` (Dot Product) is the mathematical equivalent of search.

**How to run:**
`python pytorch_rag.py`
