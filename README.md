> **"I bridge the gap between Research and Revenue."**

### 💼 Value Proposition

> "I am not just a Data Scientist who builds notebooks, nor just a Web Developer who calls APIs. I am an **AI Engineer** who builds the end-to-end infrastructure that turns Research into Revenue."

**[➡️ Read my detailed Business Case Studies (ROI Analysis)](BUSINESS_CASE_STUDIES.md)**

> I am a technical leader who has managed cross-functional teams (5+ members) to ship scalable AI products. My expertise allows me to architect complex systems (RAG, Agents, Knowledge Graphs) and guide teams through the entire lifecycle—from **mathematical first principles** to **production deployment** and **optimization**.

## 🏆 Leadership & Management Strategy

_JD Alignment: "1-2+ years in a technical leadership... Guide the architecture... Own the processes."_

- **Team Leadership:** Managed a 5-member cross-functional team at _BPOSeats_, creating a collaborative environment that launched a major e-commerce platform (20% sales boost).
- **Process Optimization:** Reduced manual content cycle time by 70% by architecting a Multi-Agent AI System ("Researcher -> Writer -> Publisher").
- **Cost & Performance:** Architected backend optimizations decreasing server costs by 15% and API latency by 20%.
- **Recruitment:** Built an AI-powered recruitment platform (LLM Matching) that reduced time-to-hire by 30%.

## 🚀 Technical Portfolio: The "CoreStory" Architecture

This repository (`ai-portfolio`) contains **20 production-grade modules** proving every requirement in the **AI Engineering Manager** job description.

### 1. Advanced RAG & Knowledge Graphs

_JD: "LlamaIndex, LangChain, Vector Databases (Neo4j, Pinecone), Document Intelligence."_

- **GraphRAG (`05_enterprise_ai_patterns/04_graph_rag_neo4j`):** Implemented a Knowledge Graph extraction engine using **Neo4j** to solve multi-hop reasoning where vector search fails.
- **Multimodal RAG (`22_multimodal_rag_vision`):** Built a Vision-RAG pipeline to query **Charts and Images** using GPT-4o-Vision.
- **Hybrid Search (`05_enterprise_ai_patterns/challenge_02_hybrid_search`):** Combined **BM25** (Keyword) + **ChromaDB** (Dense Vector) for superior recall.
- **RAG from Scratch (`04_rag_from_scratch`):** Built retrieval utilizing raw NumPy cosine similarity to demonstrate deep understanding of vector math.

### 2. Agentic AI & Orchestration

_JD: "LLM-powered systems (chat agents), LangChain, LangGraph, Tool calling."_

- **AutoGen Swarm (`21_autogen_negotiation`):** Orchestrated a **Multi-Agent automated negotiation** between a Logistics Agent and a Supplier Agent (Real-world Business Case).
- **LangGraph Implementation (`05_enterprise_ai_patterns/03_langgraph_agent`):** production-grade stateful agent workflow with cyclic graph logic.
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Designed "Newsroom" architecture where specialized agents (Researcher, Analyst, Writer) collaborate.
- **Tool Use (`challenge_11_code_interpreter`):** Built a Code Interpreter agent that writes and executes Python to solve math problems.

### 3. Production Engineering & DevOps

_JD: "Deploy scalable AI services... Docker, AWS... Benchmarking... Guardrails."_

- **Benchmarking Suite (`20_llm_benchmarking`):** Async load testing script to measure **P95 Latency** and **Throughput (TPS)** for capacity planning.
- **MLOps Pipeline (`12_mlops_pipeline`):** Production safeguards including **Data Drift Detection** (KS-Tests) and a Model Registry.
- **Safety Guardrails (`challenge_08_guardrails`):** Input/Output filtering to prevent PII leakage and Prompt Injection.
- **Deployment (`16_deployment_ab_testing`):** Containerized FastAPI services (`Dockerfile`) and A/B Testing simulators.

### 4. Versatile "Polyglot" Engineering

_JD: "Proficiency in Python... Familiarity with emerging frameworks... TypeScript."_
I choose the right tool for the job. I don't force everything into one stack.

- **Python (The Research Stack):** PyTorch, FastAPI, Pandas, Scikit-Learn.
- **TypeScript (The Product Stack):** Built type-safe extraction agents using **LangChain.js** & **Zod** (`19_typescript_agentic_workflow`).
- **Edge AI:** Exported models to **ONNX** for mobile/browser execution (`17_mobile_edge_onnx`).

### 5. Mathematical Depth & "First Principles"

_JD: "Strong problem-solving... Understanding of embeddings and tokenization."_

- **Transformers from Scratch (`01_transformer_from_scratch`):** Hand-coded Self-Attention and Positional Encoding.
- **GenAI Architecture (`07_simple_diffusion`):** Implemented DDPM and U-Net architecture.
- **Optimization (`06_moe_transformer`):** Built Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers for sparse efficiency.
