# Business Problem: Recommendation System (Matrix Factorization)

**Algorithm:** SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).

**The Question:** "What product should I show the user next?"
**The Value:** increasing Cross-Selling and User Retention (like Netflix/Amazon).

**Why SVD?**
It reduces dimensionality to find "Latent Factors" (Hidden patterns). Ideally, it realizes that User A likes "Action Movies" without us explicitly tagging the movies as "Action."
