# Business Problem: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

**Algorithm:** K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised).

**The Question:** "Who are our customers?"
**The Value:** You cannot send the same email to a student and a millionaire. Segmentation allows personalized marketing.

**Why K-Means?**
It is fast and explainable. It groups data points based on geometric distance, revealing natural clusters like "High Spenders," "Window Shoppers," etc.
