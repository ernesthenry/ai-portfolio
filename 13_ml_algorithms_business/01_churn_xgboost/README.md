# Business Problem: Customer Churn (Classification)

**Algorithm:** XGBoost (Gradient Boosted Trees).

**The Question:** "Who is leaving us?"
**The Value:** Acquiring a new customer is 5x more expensive than retaining an old one. If we can predict churn with 80% accuracy, we can save millions by targeted intervention.

**Why XGBoost?**
Unlike Deep Learning, XGBoost works beautifully on "Tabular Data" (Excel sheets). It handles missing values natively and provides feature importance (telling us _why_ people leave).
