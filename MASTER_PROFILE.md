# 👨‍💻 Engineering Profile: [Your Name]

## Lead AI Engineer | Full Stack ML Architect

I don't just tune models; I build **Production-Grade AI Systems**.
My expertise spans the entire lifecycle: **Math -> Model -> Infrastructure -> App Integration**.

---

## 🧠 1. Core AI & Mathematical Depth

_I understand the "Black Box"._

- **Transformers from Scratch:** Built the "Attention is All You Need" architecture in raw PyTorch (`01_transformer_from_scratch`).
- **Diffusion Models:** Implemented DDPM math and U-Net architecture (`07_simple_diffusion`).
- **Vector Search Math:** Built a RAG engine using raw Matrix Multiplication vs L2-Normalized Embeddings (`09_pytorch_rag_no_libs`).
- **Classical ML:** Implemented SVMs, Isolation Forests (Fraud), and K-Means from the ground up (`14_classical_ml_zoo`).

## ⚙️ 2. Large Language Models (LLMs) & GenAI

_I know how to tame and scale Giants._

- **Optimization:** Fine-tuned 20B+ models using **QLoRA** (4-bit quantization) to fit on consumer GPUs (`02_finetune_llm_qlora`).
- **Architecture:** Implemented **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** routing layers for sparse computing (`06_moe_transformer`).
- **Agentic Workflows:** Built stateful, multi-agent systems using **LangGraph** (Draft -> Critique -> Publish flows) (`05_enterprise_ai_patterns`).

## 🛠 3. Enterprise AI Patterns

_I build systems that businesses trust._

- **Corrective RAG:** Built self-correcting retrieval agents with fallback to web search.
- **Guardrails:** Implemented PII redaction and Prompt Injection defenses (`challenge_08_guardrails`).
- **Cost Routing:** Designed semantic routers to send queries to cheaper models (Llama-3 vs GPT-4) based on complexity (`challenge_04_cost_router`).
- **Structured IO:** Forced LLMs to output strict JSON schemas for database integration (`challenge_05_structured_extraction`).

## 🚢 4. MLOps & Production Engineering

_I deploy systems that stay up._

- **Deployment:** Dockerized FastAPI Microservices for real-time inference (`16_deployment_ab_testing`).
- **Monitoring:** Implemented Data Drift Detection (KS-Tests) to alert on model degradation (`12_mlops_pipeline`).
- **Validation:** Built A/B Testing simulators to statistically prove business value (`16_deployment_ab_testing`).

## 📱 5. Application Integration

_I bridge the gap between Python and the World._

- **Edge AI:** Exported PyTorch models to **ONNX** for running on iOS/Android/Browser (`17_mobile_edge_onnx`).
- **Full Stack:** Built Async Streaming APIs (FastAPI) connected to Reactive Frontends (`18_full_stack_integration`).
- **Latency Optimization:** Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) for perceived zero-latency UX (`01_fastapi_streaming`).
